                    <p>International travel can get a bit tiring . But it doesn't have to be uncomfortable. We make
                        the hassles of transportation easier with flights as direct as possible, 4-berth couchettes
                        on overnight trains and buses that are clean, operated by reputable companies and drivers,
                        and not packed to capacity. So you arrive in a new city feeling refreshed and ready to
                        explore.</p>

                        work culture demands that we check up on groups during their travels and swoop in during
                        emergencies (no matter how large or small) to save the day. Something falling short of your
                        expectations? We're experts at fixing things fast. And we back up our promises with our
                        Service Guarantee.

                        how to explain the history and culture of each destination so students are engagedâ€”and
                        sometimes laughing out loud. It's no wonder group leaders are constantly telling us how
                        much they adore them.

                    <p>Another aspect of maximizing travel time is making use of ALL of the day, including the
                        night! Our centrally located hotels allow our groups time to further explore before/after
                        dinner, an opportunity that just isn't available with ordinary travel companies. Evenings
                        are a great time to see another side of a city like the locals do and we don't want you to
                        miss out.
