                        At Bluebell, we firmly believe that travel plays a
                        vital role in shaping people's mindsets and their
                        views of what life is. An international educational
                        tour to overseas organizations is an experience that
                        students will cherish as one of the highlights of
                        their learning years. Such educational tours enable
                        students to develop a number of skills.

                        working
                        mechanisms of heavy tools and machineries.  The branch applies principles of engineering,
                        physics
                        and material science for the design, analysis, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical
                        systems.
                        A course in mechanical engineering makes a student gain knowledge and experience in the
                        designing
                        of electric motors, automobiles, aircrafts and other heavy vehicles.</p>

                        of a
                        pure drug substance into a dosage form. The other branches of Pharmaceutical Technology include
                        Pharmaceutical formulation, Pharmaceutical manufacturing, dispensing pharmacy, physical
                        pharmacy

                        and use
                        them to produce attractive, marketable food products with longer shelf-lifes.</p>
